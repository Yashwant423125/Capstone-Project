    "Now that you have been equipped with the skills and the tools to use location data to explore a geographical location, over the course of two weeks, you will have the opportunity to be as creative as you want and come up with an idea to leverage the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities of your choice or to come up with a problem that you can use the Foursquare location data to solve. If you cannot think of an idea or a problem, here are some ideas to get you started:\n",

    "In Module 3, we explored New York City and the city of Toronto and segmented and clustered their neighborhoods. Both cities are very diverse and are the financial capitals of their respective countries. One interesting idea would be to compare the neighborhoods of the two cities and determine how similar or dissimilar they are. Is New York City more like Toronto or Paris or some other multicultural city? I will leave it to you to refine this idea. In a city of your choice, if someone is looking to open a restaurant, where would you recommend that they open it? Similarly, if a contractor is trying to start their own business, where would you recommend that they setup their office?\n",
    "\n",
    "U.S. has been a land of opportunity for many who seek a better live and a fresh start. Not all migrants have technical skills or are willing to join the corporate world of a very different culture. Starting one's own business such as a restaurant may be more viable for such individuals. This project demonstrates how the basic fundamental law of Demand and Supply can be used to analyze statistical data We will use the greater area of Dallas and narrow down to a few feasible neighborhoods. The same process can be repeated with other areas of interest."
